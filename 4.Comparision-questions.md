### 1. What is the difference between == and === operators
- [x] Answer: JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

- Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
- Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,
- NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
- Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
- Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
- Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
- Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e, null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

Some of the example which covers the above cases,
```js
    0 == false   // true
    0 === false  // false
    1 == "1"     // true
    1 === "1"    // false
    null == undefined // true
    null === undefined // false
    '0' == false // true
    '0' === false // false
    []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
    {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
```

### 2. What will be the output when the following code is executed? Explain.

```js
console.log(false == '0')
console.log(false === '0')
```
- [x] Answer: 
```js
true
false
```
In JavaScript, there are two sets of equality operators. The triple-equal operator === behaves like any traditional equality operator would: evaluates to true if the two expressions on either of its sides have the same type and the same value. The double-equal operator, however, tries to coerce the values before comparing them. It is therefore generally good practice to use the === rather than ==. The same holds true for !== vs !=.

### 3.  Name all JavaScript’s Boolean logical operators:

- [x] Answer: 

The AND && operator, the NOT ! operator, and the OR || operator.

The && AND operator requires both operands to be true to evaluate to true. For example:
```js
if (age >= 21 && drinksConsumed <= 10) { 
     console.log('You can drink here.')
}
```
The || OR operator requires one of the operands to be true to evaluate to true. For example:
```js
if (age >= 12 || height >= 150) { 
     console.log('You can ride the rollercoaster.') 
}
```
The ! NOT operator evaluates to true if the two operands are not equal. For example:
```js
x = 7;
y = 5;

!(x == y) // evaluates to true
```
### 4. What will be the output when the following code is executed? Explain.
```js
5!=='5'
```
- [x] Answer: true
  
### 5. What will be the output when the following code is executed? Explain.
```js
true && false || true
```
- [x] Answer: true
  
### 6. What will be the output when the following code is executed? Explain.
```js
(true || false ) && true
```
- [x] Answer: true

### 5.  What is the nullish coalescing operator in JavaScript?

- [x] Answer: 
Nullish coalescing is a JavaScript logical operator represented by two question marks (??). Nullish coalescing is an operator that returns the first “defined” value. “defined” here refers to an expression whose value is neither null nor undefined


Let’s look at a few examples of this operator when given a different set of arguments.
```js
let undefinedUser;
console.log(undefinedUser ?? 'Anonymous'); // will print 'Anonymous'

let definedUser = 'Ryan';
console.log(definedUser ?? 'Anonymouse') // will print 'Ryan'
```
