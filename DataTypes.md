### 1. What is NaN property
The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases
```js
Math.sqrt(-1);
parseInt("Hello");
````

### 2. What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword

`let` is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming languages like Scheme and Basic. It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages that use let already as a traditional keyword as close to var as possible.
