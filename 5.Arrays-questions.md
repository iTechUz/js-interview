### 1.  How can you create an Array in JavaScript?
You can define arrays using the array literal as follows-
```js
var x = [];
var y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### 2. What are the .slice() and .splice() methods, and how do they differently affect arrays?

- [x] Answer:

`.slice()` doesn’t modify the original array, and returns the elements from the array, minus the instructed elements to be sliced off based on the numbers instructed in the brackets.

If one parameter is written, this will be used as the start parameter, and if two parameters are written, the second element will be used as the end parameter.

```js
const reasonsToTryBootdotdev = ["free trial", "interactive", "browser based", "helpful community", "range of content"]; 

reasonsToTryBootdotdev.slice(2,4)
// ["browser based", "helpful community"]
```
The `.splice()` method instead modifies the original array. It returns the deleted elements as arrays, and is often use to insert or remove elements to or from an existing array.

```js
const reasonsToTryBootdotdev = ["free trial", "interactive", "browser based", "helpful community", "range of content"]; 
const removed = reasonsToTryBootdotdev.splice(2,4)
console.log(reasonsToTryBootdotdev)
// ["free trial","interactive"]

console.log(removed)
// ["browser based","helpful community","range of content"]
```

### 3. What is the output of the following code?

```js
const arrayOfOddNumbers = [1, 3, 5];
arrayOfOddNumbers[100] = 199;
console.log(arrayOfOddNumbers.length);
```
- [x] Answer:
```js
101
```
The reason for this solution is as follows: JavaScript placesempty as a value for indices 3 - 99.

### 4. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```js
let arrayOfLetters = ['a','b','c','d','e','f'];
const anotherArrayOfLetters = arrayOfLetters;
arrayOfLetters = [];
console.log(anotherArrayOfLetters);
```
- [x] Answer:
```js
['a','b','c','d','e','f']
```
When we carry out the above (containing arrayOfLetters = []) you create a new array and break the old reference. Thus, anotherArrayOfLetters has no effect on it since it is still pointing to the old array.


### 5. How could you print unique values from an array?

```js
const arrOfNum = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6];
console.log(getUniqueValues(arrOfNum)); // [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
```
- [x] Answer:

```js
function getUniqueValues(arrOfNum) {
  const set = new Set(arrOfNum);
  return [...set];
}
``` 
### 6. Given the following line of code, what would be the output of the console?

```js
var foo = new Array(3);
console.log(foo);
```
- [x] Answer:  [undefined, undefined, undefined]

Hint: When you instantiate the JavaScript Array() constructor, and pass in a single number, that number will indicate the length of the array, but the elements are still not initialized (i.e. they are all undefined)

### 7. What does the array.shift() method do, and what does it return?

- [x] Answer: It removes the first element from the array and returns that element

### 8.  What a pop()method in JavaScript is?
- [x] Answer: 
The pop() method is similar to the shift() method, but the difference is that the Shift method works at the array’s start. The pop() method takes the last element off of the given array and returns it. The array on which it is called is then altered.

### Example:
```js
var cloths = ["Shirt", "Pant", "TShirt"];
cloths.pop();
//Now cloth becomes Shirt,Pant
```

### 9. What is the use of the Push method in JavaScript?
- [x] Answer: 
The push method is used to add or append one or more elements to an Array end. Using this method, we can append multiple elements by passing multiple arguments.

### 10.  What is the unshift method in JavaScript?
- [x] Answer:
Unshift method is like the push method, which works at the beginning of the array. This method is used to prepend one or more elements to the beginning of the array.

### 11 Write a JavaScript function to subtract elements from one another in an array.

- [x] Answer:
```js
function subtraction(arr) 
 {
  if (Object.prototype.toString.call(arr) === '[object Array]') {
    var total = arr[0];
    if (typeof (total) !== 'number') {
      return false;
    }
    for (var i = 1, length = arr.length; i < length; i++)
    {
      if (typeof (arr[i]) === 'number')
      {
        total -= arr[i];
      } 
      else 
      return false;
    }
    return total;
   } 
    else
     return false;
  }
console.log(subtraction([7,3, 2,-1]));
```
