### 1. How do you generate random integers
- [x] Answer: You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,
```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
```
Note: Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)


### 2. What is the output of below code
```js
console.log(Math.max());
1: undefined
2: Infinity
3: 0
4: -Infinity
```
- [x] Answer:
`-Infinity` is the initial comparant because almost every other value is bigger. So when no arguments are provided, `-Infinity` is going to be returned. Note: Zero number of arguments is a valid case.

### 3. What will the code below output? Explain your answer.
```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);
```
- [x] Answer: An educated answer to this question would simply be: “You can’t be sure. it might print out 0.3 and true, or it might not. Numbers in JavaScript are all treated with floating point precision, and as such, may not always yield the expected results.”

The example provided above is classic case that demonstrates this issue. Surprisingly, it will print out:
```js
0.30000000000000004
false
```
A typical solution is to compare the absolute difference between two numbers with the special constant Number.EPSILON:
```js
function areTheNumbersAlmostEqual(num1, num2) {
	return Math.abs( num1 - num2 ) < Number.EPSILON;
}
console.log(areTheNumbersAlmostEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3));
```
### 4. What would the following lines of code output to the console?

```js
console.log("0 || 1 = "+(0 || 1));
console.log("1 || 2 = "+(1 || 2));
console.log("0 && 1 = "+(0 && 1));
console.log("1 && 2 = "+(1 && 2));
```
- [x] Answer: The code will output the following four lines:

```js
0 || 1 = 1
1 || 2 = 1
0 && 1 = 0
1 && 2 = 2
```
In JavaScript, both || and && are logical operators that return the first fully-determined “logical value” when evaluated from left to right.

The or (||) operator. In an expression of the form X||Y, X is first evaluated and interpreted as a boolean value. If this boolean value is true, then true (1) is returned and Y is not evaluated, since the “or” condition has already been satisfied. If this boolean value is “false”, though, we still don’t know if X||Y is true or false until we evaluate Y, and interpret it as a boolean value as well.

Accordingly, 0 || 1 evaluates to true (1), as does 1 || 2.

The and (&&) operator. In an expression of the form X&&Y, X is first evaluated and interpreted as a boolean value. If this boolean value is false, then false (0) is returned and Y is not evaluated, since the “and” condition has already failed. If this boolean value is “true”, though, we still don’t know if X&&Y is true or false until we evaluate Y, and interpret it as a boolean value as well.

However, the interesting thing with the && operator is that when an expression is evaluated as “true”, then the expression itself is returned. This is fine, since it counts as “true” in logical expressions, but also can be used to return that value when you care to do so. This explains why, somewhat surprisingly, 1 && 2 returns 2 (whereas you might it expect it to return true or 1).

### 5. What would be the result of 2+5+”3″?

Since 2 and 5 are integers, they will be added numerically. And since 3 is a string, its concatenation will be done. So the result would be 73. The ” ” makes all the difference here and represents 3 as a string and not a number.

### 6.  What will the following code output?
### Problem:
```js
(function() {
  var a = b = 5;
console.log(b);
})();
```
- [x] Answer:
The code above will output 5 even though it seems as if the variable was declared within a function and can't be accessed outside of it. This is because

```js
var a = b = 5;
```
is interpreted the following way:
```js
var a = b;
b = 5;
```
But b is not declared anywhere in the function with var so it is set equal to 5 in the global scope.

### 7. Write a JavaScript function to calculate the nth root of a number. Go to the editor
Test Data :
console.log(nthroot(64, 2));
8
console.log(nthroot(64, -2));
0.125
- [x] Answer:
```js
function nthroot(x, n)
   {
    ng = n % 2;
    if((ng == 1) || x<0)
       x = -x;
    var r = Math.pow(x, 1 / n);
    n = Math.pow(r, n);
  
    if(Math.abs(x - n) < 1 && (x > 0 === n > 0))
      return ng ? -r : r; 
   }
console.log(nthroot(64, 2));
console.log(nthroot(64, -2));
```
Sample Output:
```
8
0.125
```
