### Questions about `for` operator in JavaScript

### 1. What loops are available in JavaScript?
- [x] Answer:
  The "for" loop with "for..in" and "for...of" variations, the "while" and "do...while" loops.

### 2.What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?  

- [x] Answer:

For objects:
- `for` loops - `for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }`. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an obj.hasOwnProperty(property) check before using it.
- `Object.keys()` - `Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.keys()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` - `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`.` Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.
For arrays:
- `for` loops - `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`. The common pitfall here is that var is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces let which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`.
- `forEach` - `arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... })`. This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the index if all you need is the array elements. There are also the `every` and `some` methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.

Most of the time, I would prefer the `.forEach` method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. `for` loops allow more flexibility, such as prematurely terminate the loop using `break` or incrementing the iterator more than once per loop.

### 3. Write a loop that prints every number divisible by 3 from 1-200:
- [x] Answer:
```js
for (let i = 1; i < 201; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(i)
  }
}
```

### 4.  How do break and continue statements differ and where would you use each?
- [x] Answer:
  
`Break` statements cause the code to exit a loop immediately.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  if (i === 10) { break; } // this ends the loop early (at 10 instead of 100)
  console.log('the current number is: ' + i)
}
```
`Continue` statements immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  if (i%2 === 0) { continue; } // skips even numbers
  console.log('The number is odd');
}
```
### 5. FizzBuzz Challenge
### Problem
Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5.

- [x] Answer:
Check out this version of FizzBuzz:

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let f = i % 3 == 0,
    b = i % 5 == 0;
  console.log(f ? (b ? 'FizzBuzz' : 'Fizz') : b ? 'Buzz' : i);
}
```
### 6.How to use Loops in Javascript?
- [x] Answer: There are mainly four types of loops in JavaScript.

- for loop

- for/in a loop (explained later)

- while loop

- do…while loop

Syntax:
```JS
for(statement1; statement2; statment3)
 
{
 
lines of code to be executed
 
}
```
1. Statement1 is executed first, even before executing the looping code. So, this statement is normally used to assign values to variables used inside the loop.
2. The statement2 is the condition to execute the loop.
3. The statement3 is executed every time after the looping code is executed.

### while loop
Syntax:
```
while(condition)

{

lines of code to be executed

}
```
The “while loop” is executed as long as the specified condition is true. Inside the while loop, you should include the statement that will end the loop at some point in time. Otherwise, your loop will never end, and your browser may crash.

### do…while loop
Syntax:
```JS
do

{

block of code to be executed

} while (condition)
```
The do…while loop is very similar to the while loop. The only difference is that in do…while loop, the block of code gets executed once even before checking the condition.
