### 1. What is typeof operator?
 - [x] Answer: JavaScript provides a typeof operator that can examine a value and tell you what type it is:
```js
var a;
typeof a;				// "undefined"

a = "hello world";
typeof a;				// "string"

a = 42;
typeof a;				// "number"

a = true;
typeof a;				// "boolean"

a = null;
typeof a;				// "object" -- weird, bug

a = undefined;
typeof a;				// "undefined"

a = { b: "c" };
typeof a;				// "object"

```
### 2. What is the object type? 
 - [x] Answer: 
The `object` type refers to a compound value where you can set properties (named locations) that each hold their own values of any type.

```js
var obj = {
	a: "hello world", // property
	b: 42,
	c: true
};

obj.a;		// "hello world", accessed with doted notation
obj.b;		// 42
obj.c;		// true

obj["a"];	// "hello world", accessed with bracket notation
obj["b"];	// 42
obj["c"];	// true
```
Bracket notation is also useful if you want to access a property/key but the name is stored in another variable, such as:

```js
var obj = {
	a: "hello world",
	b: 42
};

var b = "a";

obj[b];			// "hello world"
obj["b"];		// 42
```
### 3. What is NaN property?
 - [x] Answer: The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases
```js
Math.sqrt(-1);
parseInt("Hello");
```

### 4. What will be the output when the following code is executed? Explain!
```js
     console.log(false == '0')
     console.log(false === '0')
```
 - [x] Answer: 
 - true
 - false
Explanation: == equal to, === equal to with datatype check!

### 5.  What will be the output of the following code?
```js
var foo = true;
        console.log(!foo);
        console.log(foo + 0);
        console.log(foo + "xyz");
        console.log(foo + false);
        console.log(foo && foo);
```
- [x] Answer:  Here you‘re looking for knowledge of how variable typing and the logical operators work in JavaScript. It will output the following to the console:
```js
        true
        1
        truexyz
        1
        true
```
### 6. Why is namespacing important when coding in JavaScript? Give an example of how you would implement namespacing to group this sample configuration data?

```js
          var DEBUG = true;
          var MAX_SIZE = 100;
          var FEED_URL = "http://myfeed.com/feed/";
          var POST_IDS = [1, 2, 3];
```
- [x] Answer:  Namespacing is used to group things like variables, functions and objects together with unique names. It helps to avoid naming conflicts, logically separate code and make code more reusable.

Namespacing in JavaScript is often done using objects. For the example above:
```js
 var Config = {
                 DEBUG: true,
                 MAX_SIZE: 100,
                 FEED_URL: "http://myfeed.com/feed/",
                 POST_IDS: [123, 456, 789]
          };

```


  A variable in this namespace can be accessed like so:

 ```js
     Config.MAX_SIZE;
  ```

### 7. What is the output out of the following code? Explain your answer.
```js
var a={},
    b={key:'b'},
    c={key:'c'};

a[b]=123;
a[c]=456;

console.log(a[b]);
```
- [x] Answer: The output of this code will be 456 (not 123).

The reason for this is as follows: When setting an object property, JavaScript will implicitly stringify the parameter value. In this case, since b and c are both objects, they will both be converted to "[object Object]". As a result, a[b] anda[c] are both equivalent to a["[object Object]"] and can be used interchangeably. Therefore, setting or referencing a[c] is precisely the same as setting or referencing a[b].

### 8. Explain Null and Undefined in JavaScript ?

- [x] Answer: JavaScript (and by extension TypeScript) has two bottom types: null and undefined. They are intended to mean different things:
- Something hasn't been initialised : undefined.
- Something is currently unavailable: null.

### 9. What is the difference between Attributes and Property?
- Attributes-  provide more details on an element like id, type, value etc.

- Property-  is the value assigned to the property like type=”text”, value=’Name’ etc.

### 10 What is a Typed language?
Typed Language is in which the values are associated with values and not with variables. It is of two types:

- `Dynamically`: in this, the variable can hold multiple types; like in JS a variable can take number, chars.
- `Statically`: in this, the variable can hold only one type, like in Java a variable declared of string can take only set of characters and nothing else.
  
### 11. What is the "null" in JavaScript?
- [x] Answer: 
  
The JS script returns "null" if the requested value is "empty". It may happen when you try to request a deleted element of the script or when a variable value was assigned with null to check it for changes during the script execution.

```js
let a = null;
console.log(a);
//Output:
null
```
### 12. What is the "undefined" in JavaScript?
- [x] Answer: 
The "undefined" may be returned when you request a declared variable without any assigned value.

```js
let a;
console.log(a);
//Output:
undefined
```
### 13. What is the Array in JavaScript?
- [x] Answer:
It is the kind of Object type which contains values placed in specified by user order and has special functions and properties to work with contained data.

### 13. What is the difference between null & undefined?
Undefined means a variable has been `declared` but has not yet been `assigned` a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

### 13 What is NaN in JavaScript?
`NaN` is a short form of `Not a Number`. Since NaN always compares unequal to any number, including `NaN`, it is usually used to indicate an error condition for a function that should return a valid number. When a string or something else is being converted into a number and that cannot be done, then we get to see `NaN`.

### 14. How can you convert the string of any base to integer in JavaScript?
The `parseInt()` function is used to convert numbers between different bases. It takes the string to be converted as its first parameter, and the second parameter is the base of the given string.

For example-

```js
	
parseInt("4F", 16)
```
### 15. What are the properties in JavaScript?

- [x] Answer:
  
It is the basic characteristic of an object, generated by default and based on the structure of property name plus property value. For example all strings in JavaScript always have the property "length", which describes how many characters in it.

### 16. How are object properties assigned?
- [x] Answer:
Properties are assigned to objects in the following way –
```JS
obj ["class"] = 12;
or
obj.class = 12;
```
